background-image are decorative
CSS is a style is decorative is not content.

across --->

background-position: top left; position by default

background-size: auto; size by default .. won't do anything
background-size: contain; Make sure your image is visible.
background-size: cover; fill the entire space .. (Can lose quality of image)
